/**
 * What a dollar costs in EMBER, as this service reads it — docs/ecosystem/15 §3.2.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **FORGE CREATE PRICES IN USD AND SETTLES IN EMBER. THIS MODULE IS THE JOIN, AND OWNS NO RATE.**
 *
 * Lifted from `billing/src/pricingclient.ts` deliberately and with its reasoning intact. This
 * service was the one that did NOT migrate on 2026-08-04, and the estate's own answer to "how does
 * a service price in dollars and charge in EMBER" already existed and was already argued. A second,
 * differently-shaped join here would be a second set of failure modes to discover.
 *
 * The order is durable in US cents (migration 6, which argues why). The ledger is posted in
 * EMBER, because EMBER is an asset a chain backs and the estate's central guarantee is that no
 * balance may exist that the chain does not back. Neither of those two numbers can be derived
 * from the other without a rate, and the rate belongs to `micro-pricing`. So it is read per
 * purchase and RECORDED ON THE PURCHASE ROW that used it (`purchases.rate_usd_scaled`), which is
 * the same discipline `adminapi.ts` applies to the fee-recycle percentage: one authority, and the
 * row says which answer it got.
 *
 * A cached rate is deliberately not offered. A stale rate here does not degrade a display, it
 * charges a customer the wrong amount of money.
 *
 * ── FAIL CLOSED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Pricing unreachable, or answering with `usable: false` — no rate was read, and an unread rate is
 * not a default one. The purchase is REFUSED. This is a real availability coupling and it is the
 * correct one: you cannot charge somebody in a currency you cannot price, and the alternative to
 * refusing is guessing at how much of their money to take.
 *
 * Note that `usable: false` is a 200 on the other side, with a `reason`
 * (`pricing/src/server.ts` — "a 404 would be a lie about the asset existing and a 503
 * would suggest retrying will help"). So a status check alone would read an unusable rate as a
 * usable one. **The flag is what is checked, not the status.** That is the same defect shape as
 * the wallet that read an unknown receipt as a successful payment.
 *
 * ── WHICH LEG, AND WHY NOT THE SPREAD ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `rate.usdScaled` — mid-market — and not `usdSellScaled`/`usdBuyScaled`. The spread is R7 in
 * docs/ecosystem/15 §3, a distinct revenue line charged on coin↔unit CONVERSION. A deploy
 * purchase is not a conversion; the customer is buying a product whose stated price is $25.00.
 * Applying the conversion spread here would mean the amount actually taken did not correspond to
 * the stated dollar price, which is exactly what the owner's decision — "stated USD is unchanged"
 * — forbids. If the platform later wants a purchase spread it should be a stated, quoted line
 * item, not a silent adjustment to a rate lookup.
 *
 * ── THE ADMINISTERED RATE IS NOT A MARKET PRICE, AND THAT IS FINE HERE ────────────────────────
 *
 * EMBER's rate is administered (`pricing/src/rates.ts`), because Hearth has no exchange
 * listing. That is precisely why THE ORDER must not be stored in EMBER — an operator editing
 * the figure would silently restate the price of every unpaid deploy. It is not a reason to avoid it at settlement:
 * at settlement it is doing the only job it can do, converting a stated dollar price into the
 * asset the customer actually holds, at a figure the platform has published and stands behind.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## Route, verified against the other side
 *
 * `GET /rates/:asset` — `pricing/src/server.ts`. **Unauthenticated**: the rate board is public
 * in this estate by design (`pricing/src/server.ts`), and the neighbouring `/admin/prices`
 * routes are the ones behind `requireAdminAuthority`. So this client presents no credential and
 * needs no service-token grant.
 *
 * The body is `{ rate: RateView }` (`pricing/src/quotes.ts`), of which this file reads exactly
 * three fields: `usable`, `reason`, `usdScaled`. `rateScale` is also published — "so a consumer
 * never has to assume the scale it is doing BigInt maths at" — and is checked rather than
 * assumed, because assuming it is how a rate is applied at a factor of a million out.
